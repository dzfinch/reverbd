# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Reverbd is under active development. Security fixes are applied to:
- The latest release (if releases exist), and
- The current `main` branch

If you are using an older version, please upgrade and re-test before reporting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately using one of the following:
- Email: dryver.finch@outlook.com

Include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected endpoints/files and version/commit hash
- Any relevant logs or screenshots (please redact sensitive data)

## Response Timeline
We aim to:
- Acknowledge your report within **72 hours**
- Provide a status update within **7 days**
- Release a fix as quickly as feasible based on severity

If the issue is confirmed, we will coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline with you.

## Scope
This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- Reverbd application code and first-party services
- Our official deployments (when applicable)

Out of scope (examples):
- Social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks
- Denial-of-service (DoS) and high-volume automated scanning
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services outside our control
- Reports requiring access to accounts/data not owned by the reporter

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research. If you:
- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Only access data necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Do not publicly disclose the issue before we’ve had a reasonable chance to fix it

…we will not pursue legal action against you for your research.

## Disclosure
Please do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until:
- We have released a fix, or
- We have agreed on a disclosure timeline together

Thank you for helping keep Reverbd and its users safe.
