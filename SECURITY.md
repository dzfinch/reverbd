# Security Policy

This repository is currently **private** and under active development.

This document defines internal expectations for handling security issues and
provides a placeholder for a public disclosure policy when the project becomes
publicly accessible.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability or sensitive issue related to this
codebase, **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately to:
- Project owner: Dryver Finch
- Contact: dryver.finch@outlook.com

Please include:
- A brief description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Affected files, endpoints, or configurations
- Any relevant context (logs, screenshots, etc.)

## Handling & Disclosure
- Security issues should be addressed with priority relative to severity.
- Fixes should be merged via a private branch or pull request.
- Public disclosure will not occur until a fix is in place and the project
  becomes publicly accessible.

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- Application code in this repository
- Configuration and deployment artifacts tracked here

Third-party dependencies and services are handled according to their own
security policies and update cycles.

## Future Updates
This policy will be expanded once:
- The repository becomes public, or
- The application has external users or partners
